# Unit 11 Homework: Mission to Mars

This activity was a mini web-scraping and data analysis project incorporating news articles about Mars. I read HTML elements on a page, identified their id and class attributes, and use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. I scraped various types of information including HTML tables and recurring elements, like multiple news articles on a webpage.
